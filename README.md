    * Developed a bookmarking chrome extension to collect grant websites using electronJs using Python
    * Create web scraping scripts to collect relevant grant information from bookmarked websites 
    * Database management, collected, analyzed, and interpreted raw data from various sources
* Web Analytics Team:
    * Collection, reporting, and analysis of website data through the use of Google Analytics software.

     
*Tools: Beautiful Soup, Selenium, ntlk, Google Analytics*

### Practicum by Yandex Projects:
* Machine Learning
    * [Gold Recovery Model](https://github.com/giova22i/Gold-Recovery-ML): Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry. The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore.
    * [introML](https://github.com/giova22i/introML): Identify the right plan for each subscriber based on their behavior, using the historical data available from Telecom Company Plans. Build machine learning model with highest accuracy.
    * [Bank Churn](https://github.com/giova22i/supervisedlearning): Creating a classification model to predict customer churn for a bank from an imbalanced dataset.
    * [Oil Well Model](https://github.com/giova22i/MLB): Build a Linear Regression model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin. Analyze potential profit and risks using the Bootstrapping technique.
   


*Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib*

* Data Analysis and Visualisation 
    *  [Video Game Sales Analysis](https://github.com/giova22i/Video-Game-Sales-Analysis): Data Analysis identifying what factors make a video game succeed.  Identify patterns in historical game sales data, analyze metrics for each video game platform, and conduct statistical hypothesis testing to find potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.
    * [Telecom Prepaid Plan Analysis](https://github.com/giova22i/Prepaid-Plan-Analysis): Preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. Analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue. Conduct statistical hypothesis testing on profit from different plan users and different regions.
    * [Vehicle Price Analysis](https://github.com/giova22i/Practicum-EDA): Analysis on what factors affect the price of a vehicle to be listed on a car sales website.

*Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib, ScriPy*

* Data Collection and Storage (SQL)
    * [Taxi Ride Analysis](https://github.com/giova22i/SQL-Project): Data Analysis on Chicago taxicab rides and weather reports to advise hypothetical ride-sharing company Zuber. Study a database, analyze data from competitors, and test hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.
    
*Tools: Pandas, SQL, scipy.stats,numpy*



### Undergraduate Research Projects (University at Buffalo)
* Survey Data Analysis   
    * [Ethnic-Identity-Development-Research-Project](https://github.com/giova22i/Ethnic-Identity-Development-Research-Project):  Research of ethnic identity development by examining how three components of ethnic identity: ethnic search, achievement and commitment; change across the transition from high school to college.
    * [Effect of Anxiety on Self Estimates of Intelligence](https://github.com/giova22i/Anxiety-Effect-on-SEI): Determine if higher levels of state anxiety would lead to lower self-estimates of intelligence among undergraduate students.
    * [Advanced Psych Research Methods Research Project](https://github.com/giova22i/Psych-Research-Project): Experimental analysis to examine the relationship between phone use and the amount of sleep acquired

Tools: *SPSS Statistics*

Psychological Assessment Scales and Measures:
   * *Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM)*
   * *State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)*
