Elsie H. Hillman Foundation Grants,"Mission

The Elsie H. Hillman Foundation's mission is to improve the quality of life in Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania through strategic and thoughtful grantmaking in support of a wide range of institutions to advance community development, health, education, human services, the arts, and the environment - with a primary focus on investing in women, minorities, and civic leadership programs.

Overview

Elsie Hillman (1925-2015) epitomized the best of philanthropy in Pittsburgh for over 60 years. To everyone who had the pleasure of meeting her, she was simply ""Elsie,"" and she worked tirelessly to make Pittsburgh a better place, with particular attention to helping those who didn't have the knowledge, the access, or just that bit of encouragement needed to help themselves. She was a pioneer as a political leader who for over 60 years worked tirelessly to elect candidates from school board members to President of the United States, but her political work, civic activities, and philanthropic efforts were always intertwined. Elsie was always in it to make everything better for others in some way. The Elsie Hilliard Hillman Foundation was formed in 2006 with a gift from her husband, Henry L. Hillman, on the occasion of her 80th birthday, ""given with love forever."" Henry created the Foundation as a tribute to Elsie and to provide her with dedicated resources to pursue her own philanthropic agenda and to support the organizations and causes that mattered most to her. Although the Foundation has a wide range of interests, over the nine years for which Elsie served as its chair, she emphasized the need to support projects and organizations that help and promote women and minorities. These interests remain a focus for the Foundation today, as it continues its work as a testimony to the impact of Elsie's selfless commitment to the people of Pittsburgh.

Guiding Principles

The Elsie H. Hillman Foundation invests in the growth of young civic leaders and in building communities that improve quality of life for all citizens and particularly for women and minorities.

* To live up to its ""Most Livable"" title, Pittsburgh must continuously invest in the creation of opportunities for women and minorities. People of all different colors, genders, cultures, sexual orientations, backgrounds, and beliefs deserve to have a voice and to be fully engaged in shaping the future of the region.
* ""Don't be a spectator. You are needed in every corner of the community."" Elsie shared this observation with the writers of an Institute of Politics case study on her political life. She firmly believed that leadership, volunteerism, and active engagement in public life are needed in every neighborhood, especially among the region's young people.
* Neighbors should help each other, injecting a healthy dose of fun and joy along the way. Sometimes our neighbors just need a helping hand. Such needs can arise from a flood, fire, an act of violence, financial crisis, government funding cuts, or other unexpected life turmoil.",http://hillmanfamilyfoundations.org/foundations/elsie-h-hillman-foundation/
Mary Hillman Jennings Foundation Grants,"Mission

The Mary Hillman Jennings Foundation's mission is to improve the quality of life in Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania through strategic and thoughtful grantmaking in support of a wide range of institutions to advance community development, health, education, human services, the arts, and the environment, with a primary focus on improving the lives and future outlook of disadvantaged populations.

Overview

Mary Hillman Jennings (1921-1979) was involved in a wide range of community activities in Pittsburgh and, with her sister, Patricia, was a dedicated advocate for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). She created the Mary Hillman Jennings Foundation in 1968 with the intention of advancing her charitable work and her support for Pittsburgh-area nonprofit organizations. Among the wide range of programs and projects it supports, the Foundation continues to honor Mary's generosity and legacy by providing grants to assist individuals with IDD as well as other behavioral challenges.

Guiding Principles

The Mary Hillman Jennings Foundation works to ensure that citizens of southwestern Pennsylvania, including those who are too often marginalized, receive high-quality, innovative services and have the resources and opportunities to benefit fully from the region's improving quality of life.

Mary Hillman Jennings believed that a truly world-class region invests in the lives of its most vulnerable citizens and in the improvement of its most disadvantaged communities. Honoring her lifelong commitment to this principle, the Foundation will continue to focus primarily on improving quality of life for the region's citizens most likely to be left behind by rapid innovation, growth, and changing economic and social conditions.",https://hillmanfamilyfoundations.org/grants/apply/
The Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation - Humanities Program,"The Foundation intends to further the humanities along a broad front, supporting projects which address the concerns of the historical studia humanitatis: a humanistic education rooted in the great traditions of the past; the formation of human beings according to cultural, moral, and aesthetic ideals derived from that past; and the ongoing debate over how these ideals may best be conceived and realized.

Programs in the following areas are eligible: history; archaeology; literature; languages, both classical and modern; philosophy; ethics; comparative religion; the history, criticism, and theory of the arts; and those aspects of the social sciences which share the content and methods of humanistic disciplines. The Foundation welcomes projects that cross the boundaries between humanistic disciplines and explore the connection between the humanities and other areas of scholarship. Programs of institutions in Venice relating to the humanities are eligible in this category. (Individuals seeking research grants for work in Venice should see Venetian Programs.)  The geographical concentration is primarily but not exclusively directed toward European and American history and letters, broadly defined.

The Humanities Program is primarily directed to institutions of higher education and humanistic enterprises such as learned societies, museums, and major editorial projects. The program may also consider, on a selective basis, projects that increase the exposure of those outside these institutions to the humanistic experience or that strengthen preparation for the humanistic disciplines.  The prime criterion remains that of Gladys and Jean Delmas: a commitment to excellence, whether proven or promised.",http://delmas.org/grants/general-application-guidelines/

Evidence for Action: Investigator-Initiated Research to Build a Culture of Health,"Purpose
Evidence for Action (E4A), a national program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), funds research that expands the evidence needed to build a Culture of Health. A Culture of Health is broadly defined as one in which good health and well-being flourish across geographic, demographic, and social sectors; public and private decision-making is guided by the goal of fostering equitable communities; and everyone has the opportunity to make choices that lead to healthy lifestyles. RWJF's Culture of Health Action Framework, which was developed to catalyze a national movement toward improved health, well-being, and equity, guides E4A's program strategy.

Evidence for Action (E4A), a national program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), funds research that expands the evidence needed to build a Culture of Health. A Culture of Health is broadly defined as one in which good health and well-being flourish across geographic, demographic, and social sectors; public and private decisionmaking is guided by the goal of fostering equitable communities; and everyone has the opportunity to make choices that lead to healthy lifestyles. RWJF's Culture of Health Action Framework, which was developed to catalyze a national movement toward improved health, well-being, and equity, guides E4A's program strategy. Visit rwjf.org/cultureofhealth to learn more about the Action Framework and RWJF's vision for building a Culture of Health.

E4A's mission is to support rigorously designed quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research that yields convincing findings about the population health, well-being, and equity impacts of specific policies, programs and practices. We primarily target research that directly tests the impacts of interventions on health outcomes. Evidence generated through 

E4A should be useful to practitioners and policymakers in making decisions, setting priorities, and allocating resources. Accordingly, projects we fund should yield findings that are generalizable to other sites and/or populations. We are especially interested in research examining the health impacts of program or policy interventions that address factors outside the domain of health care services or public health practice.

P RO GRA M FI T 
E4A is an investigator-initiated research funding program, and as such does not pose a specific set of research questions, topics, or categories for funding. This call for proposals (CFP) offers guidance and clarification about the types of projects that are likely to be a good fit with the program's general goals and objectives. Research examples highlighted in this CFP are intended to provide context and stimulate thinking, not serve as rigid guidelines or restrictions. Investigators are encouraged to submit innovative proposals using any appropriate combination of research designs and methods.

APP RO A CHE S AND OUTCO M E S 
E4A focuses on funding research that establishes evidence of causal relationships between an intervention and population health and well-being outcomes. Interventions are defined broadly to include programs, policies, and practices; and we consider health and well-being to be represented by a wide range of physical, mental, and emotional measures. Except in specific instances described later in this CFP, studies funded by E4A must include measures of health outcomes or of behaviors or other factors that are well-established determinants of health. We are most interested in population health effects, while also differentiating outcomes among subgroups within the population, so that possible unintended consequences of interventions for disadvantaged groups are not masked by population mean effects.

E4A proposals should be designed to answer a clearly articulated, testable research question. A variety of research designs and methods may be suitable to address such questions, including experimental and quasi-experimental designs in which adequate control or comparison groups can be identified or established. Mixed methods may be appropriate to help explain mechanisms or provide context for findings. In limited cases, purely qualitative approaches may be considered for funding. E4A is particularly interested in building evidence on interventions that have immediate relevance in current social, policy, or cultural contexts, and as a rolling submission program can rapidly respond to time-sensitive funding requests. We encourage studies that take advantage of natural experiments, which involve changes in large-scale programs, policies, or practices and can sometimes provide unique opportunities to establish causation. We are also willing to consider research conducted outside the United States that demonstrates clear relevance or applicability to building a Culture of Health in the United States. Applicant organizations must be based in the United States or its territories, however; submissions from teams that include both U.S. and international members are eligible, but the lead applicant must be based in the United States.

As a research funding program, E4A does not fund the costs of program implementation or operations. Also, in line with E4A's focus on evaluating interventions, we do not fund descriptive or exploratory science, literature reviews, needs assessments, or validation of screening tools.
Below we describe general areas of interest that align with the Culture of Health Action Framework's four Action Areas, which guide E4A's funding strategy:
  Making Health a Shared Value (Action Area 1). We are interested in the extent to which social norms and values can be changed through interventions to result in better health, well-being, and equity outcomes. RWJF's vision of health as a shared value reflects the importance of establishing a population health mindset;
strengthening people's connectedness to their communities in ways that spur collective action; and civic engagement to bring about changes to society that enable populations to thrive. While we typically require that research projects examine health as a primary outcome, consideration will be given to projects that measure changes in these ""drivers"" of shared values as primary outcomes with health measures as secondary outcomes.
To learn more about the type of research that is most relevant to Making Health a Shared Value, visit www.evidenceforaction.org/mhsv.
  Fostering Cross-Sector Collaboration (Action Area 2). There is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of partnerships to improve population health, and specifically on the role that collaboration plays in achieving positive and sustainable outcomes. Empirical studies on the impacts on health outcomes resulting from collaboration across sectors could be used to inform the establishment of future networks and partnerships that address community health challenges.
  Creating Healthier, More Equitable Communities (Action Area 3). We have limited knowledge about how community-level programs and policies impact population health and equity. Research across multiple settings is needed to determine the characteristics of programs or policies that yield the greatest health impacts, and whether health benefits offset the cost of investments.
  Strengthening Integration of Health Services and Systems (Action Area 4). We need evidence on how health care systems can effectively work with nonhealth care systems or organizations, such as those providing supportive housing, healthy food access, or early childhood education. Few studies have rigorously connected strategies for integrating health care and nonhealth care organizations to individual and community health outcomes, or evaluated their return on investment.
In addition to aligning with one or more of the Action Areas, we are generally interested in research that will help inform efforts to:
  Improve health outcomes and reduce inequities. We support research that will provide evidence of what works to improve outcomes and reduce inequities, rather than research that only describes the existence or magnitude of inequities. E4A proposals should consider the equity implications of the proposed research and, when appropriate, be able to disaggregate effects among subgroups to determine if there are distinct benefits or costs for vulnerable populations.
  Establish generalizable best practices. More evidence is needed on how programs and policies can be structured to maximize returns. For example, are global or targeted interventions more effective, and what are the relative advantages to directing policies at a whole population versus individuals or subgroups at greatest risk? Are there certain life stages during which investments produce disproportionately large long-term benefits?
Findings that can be applied in a variety of policy and program contexts would be especially informative.
  Develop and validate key measures. Although our primary focus is on testing the impact of programs and policies on population health, well-being, and equity, a small portfolio of grants is dedicated to the development and validation of new measures and metrics of population health needed to capture the broader view of physical and mental health, well-being, and equity throughout the life course.

SC Johnson U.S. Grant,"Wherever we operate, we want to help make that place better, because we are there. This aspiration began more than a century ago, with our founder, Samuel Curtis Johnson. It's reinforced by our corporate values statement, and acted on by SC Johnson people around the globe.

Since 1937, SC Johnson has given five percent of all pretax profits to charities. The year 2017 marked 80 years of company giving, and nearly six decades of our charitable foundation, SC Johnson Giving, Inc.

Our primary corporate giving focus is on institutions or organizations that serve or directly affect communities where we have operations. Our areas of interest include:

Social: Initiatives that support the prevention and eradication of vector borne diseases; programs that help reduce or eliminate poverty.

While most of the organizations we support are in the United States, some of the programs provide support throughout the world.

We review every request submitted and make our decision after diligent and thoughtful consideration. Most grants awarded are for program development or specific project support as opposed to general operating expenses.

Program funding is done mainly in the New York and southern California areas. We do not make grants or loans to individuals. As philanthropists, we recognize that it is not possible to fund every project.",https://www.charlesandmildred.org/grant-application-process/
Amgen Foundation Grants,"The Amgen Foundation seeks to advance excellence in science education to inspire the next generation of innovators, and invest in strengthening communities where Amgen staff members live and work. The Amgen Foundation carefully considers each grant application it receives, seeking out diverse organizations whose philosophies, objectives and approaches align with the Foundation goals and mission.

The Foundation awards grants to local, regional, and international nonprofit organizations that are replicable, scalable and designed to have a lasting and meaningful effect in our communities. Grants should reflect Amgen's dedication to impacting lives in inspiring and innovative ways. Amgen Foundation grants range from $10,000 to multi-million dollar commitments.

The Amgen Foundation has established grant-making partnerships with qualified intermediary partners to manage donations to organizations chartered outside of the United States.

- Philanthropic Focus

Each year, the Foundation receives hundreds of grant proposals. While it is not possible for every organization to receive funding, those that are in alignment with the Foundation's guidelines and programmatic vision outlined below are given careful consideration. We welcome your ideas.

- Science Education

The Foundation is committed to raising the value of science literacy on a national and local level. The areas given priority consideration within science education are:

Jacob and Hilda Blaustein Foundation Grant - International Human Rights,"Established in 1957 and animated by the Jewish value of tzedakah (obligation to be charitable), the Jacob and Hilda Blaustein Foundation promotes social justice and human rights through six program areas:

Strengthening Public Education seeks to improve outcomes and opportunities for students and the quality of teaching and leadership in the Baltimore City school system
Arts and Culture nurtures a robust cultural scene and ensures that the arts are accessible to children and underserved audiences in the Baltimore region
Health and Mental Health aims to expand access to quality, affordable health and mental health services for low-income residents of Baltimore City and create better health outcomes locally, regionally and nationally by addressing environmental threats to human health
Strengthening Israeli Democracy works to support Israel as a pluralistic society by promoting shared society between Jewish and Arab citizens in the Negev, building the pipeline to higher education and workforce integration for Israel's ethnic minorities, and protecting Israel's environment
Jewish Life focuses on keeping Judaism meaningful and responsive to contemporary concerns through ""repairing the world"", furthering progressive and inclusive approaches to Judaism, and facilitating nuanced discourse among American Jews about Israel
International Human Rights advances women's and reproductive rights, and protects the rights of refugees and asylum seekers in the US and other countries
The Foundation supports organizations that: promote systemic change; involve constituent participation in identifying needs, planning and decision-making; encourage innovation; have clear goals, a process for evaluation and a long-range funding strategy.

International Human Rights

The Foundation's program in International Human Rights reflects the commitment of its founders to the principles of universal rights. As President of the American Jewish Committee from 1949 to 1954, Jacob Blaustein worked to protect the civil and religious rights of Jews and other minorities and to promote intergroup tolerance. He was a lifelong advocate for human rights and helped to promote the idea of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, a position that was established more than twenty years after his death in 1970.

The Foundation funds a small number of grantees that work to advance international human rights. The Foundation generally supports US based organizations that address international issues, rather than those based abroad. The Foundation rarely provides support for programs or projects that focus on one country or region.

Internationally, the Foundation works in three areas:

Advancing women's and reproductive rights. We do not provide support for domestic programs in this area.
Protecting the rights of refugees and asylum seekers who seek refuge in the United States and other countries.
Supporting cross-cutting programs that advance leadership development, capacity-building and training across issues. The Foundation does not accept unsolicited proposals in this area.
In 1971, the Foundation created and endowed the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights at the American Jewish Committee. This is an independent entity with its own governance, programmatic priorities and grantmaking program.",https://blaufund.org/proposal-guidelines/

William K. Warren Foundation Grant,"To seek funding from The William K. Warren Foundation, please read the guidelines carefully. Our guidelines have been established to help us in the decision-making process.  Due to the great volume of grant requests we receive, we are unable to review requests that do not conform to these guidelines.

GENERAL GUIDELINES
The Foundation follows general guidelines to assure proper and equitable use of the Foundation's funds.  These guidelines are in keeping with its policies and purposes and assure that allocation of such funds is made within the limits of its financial resources while also keeping in mind the wishes of its founders that the Foundation would be ""evergreen"" as opposed to seeking to disperse all of its funds as soon as possible.

Support for certain programs is not to be interpreted as a judgment of the merits of those that do not receive funds.  Rather, it is a reflection of the Foundation's belief that adherence to its guidelines, which are regularly reviewed, leads to the most effective use of its limited resources.

The Foundation is sensitive to changes in community issues and attitudes.  Within the limits of its resources, the Foundation addresses the needs that arise from the emergence of new and different social issues to maintain a balance between innovation and maintenance of ongoing programs.

This statement of policy sets forth the current views of The William K. Warren Foundation with respect to the best use of its assets.  It may be revoked or amended in any respect for any reason, and there can be no assurance that it necessarily represents future policies or activities of the Foundation.",https://www.williamkwarrenfoundation.org/request-a-grant/
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Pioneering Ideas Brief Proposals,"Introduction
As our current reality underscores, we live in a dynamic world where unforeseen global events; new technologies; scientific discoveries; changes in our climate, economy, demographics; and more continually shape where and how we live, learn, work and play. These changes will profoundly impact health equity in our society, from our individual health and the health of our families to the health of our communities.

What dramatic changes might we see in the next 5 to 15 years? What can we do today to create a better, more equitable tomorrow?   

We seek to answer these questions, anticipate the future, and support unconventional approaches and breakthrough ideas that can help lead the way to a future where everyone in the United States can live their healthiest life possible.

Purpose
Pioneering Ideas: Exploring the Future to Build a Culture of Health seeks proposals that are primed to influence health equity in the future. We are interested in ideas that address any of these four areas of focus: Future of Evidence; Future of Social Interaction; Future of Food; Future of Work. Additionally, we welcome ideas that might fall outside of these four focus areas, but which offer unique approaches to advancing health equity and our progress toward a Culture of Health.

We want to hear from scientists, anthropologists, artists, urban planners, community leaders anyone, anywhere who has a new or unconventional idea that could alter the trajectory of health, and improve health equity and well-being for generations to come. The changes we seek require diverse perspectives and cannot be accomplished by any one person, organization or sector.

The Illinois office currently manages a number of separate discretionary foundations, each with its own mission statement and funding parameters. The first step in our streamlined application process is to select a foundation toward which to apply. This step requires you to determine if there is a match between your organization's work and the funding parameters of the selected foundation.

Before You Apply
We recommend that you thoroughly research the information provided at www.bankofamerica.com/grantmaking. The website provides detailed information about each foundation, and the Find a Foundation search feature may assist you further in selecting the various foundations. Specifically, we recommend that you thoroughly read the foundation detail pages, which are 1-page summaries on each foundation, and the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) tab which provides helpful overview information.
After exploring our website, you should be able to determine:
1. An appropriate foundation by entering the Area Served and/or Program Type preference(s) in the search filter.
2. If your organization in fact meets the geographic and/or programmatic parameters of the specific foundation. Please refer to Section IV for brief details about the geographic focus area(s) and proposal due dates of each foundation.
3. The proposal deadline of the specific foundation, ensuring that your complete proposal is submitted at the appropriate time of the year.

Submitting an Application

Mathile Family Foundation Grant,"COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION

Many of Daytons young students are motivated to learn and succeed. However, a growing number lack access to educational opportunities that will help them to fulfill their potential.
At the Mathile Family Foundation, we believe that the greatest social and economic equalizer is education. So, the support of quality educational opportunities for our areas at-risk children has grown even more important for more than 25 years of service. With this in mind, the Mathile Family Foundation has established a goal to increase the number of low-income post-secondary graduates from our most-vulnerable neighborhoods. Naturally, providing tuition assistance and scholarships to increase college access and success is an integral part of our strategic equation.

Throughout our history, The Foundations support of PreK  12 education has had a focus on Catholic schools in the Dayton area. In addition to high academic expectations, we believe Catholic schools develop the solid moral and community values that prepare students to be lifelong models of strong character and compassion.

Our support of these important institutions touches many different aspects of the school community and includes an evidence based student support program called City Connects which was developed by Boston College; a leadership program for Catholic school administrators focused on professional management; and an elementary-high school alliance which not only strengthens the schools  but addresses many of the challenges students face transitioning into high school.",https://mathilefamilyfoundation.org/guidelines/
