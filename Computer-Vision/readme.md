 ## Objective
The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. Conduct the evaluation on age detection by building and evaluating a model for verifying people's age
 
 Given:
 * The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol
 * Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo
 
 ## Data Description
 * A set of photographs of people with their ages indicated is available.
   
 ## Insights
 * Identified the potential application of the age prediction model for the benefit for  supermarket chains, to enforce alcohol purchasing laws and prevent minors from purchasing alcohol.

 ##  Models Evaluated
    Sequential

 ##  Libraries Used
    Pandas
    Matplotlib.pyplot
    numpy
    sklearn
    PIL (Python Imaging Library)
    tensorflow (ResNet50, ImageDataGenerator)
    Optimizeer (Adam)
