# Computer Vision Age Detection
 The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. 
 
 ## Objective
 Conduct the evaluation on age detection by building and evaluating a model for verifying people's age
 
 Given:
 * The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol
 * Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo
 
 ## Data Description
 * A set of photographs of people with their ages indicated is available.
 
##  Libraries Used
 * Pandas
 * Matplotlib.pyplot
 * numpy
 * sklearn
 * PIL (Python Imaging Library)
 * tensorflow (ResNet50, ImageDataGenerator)
 * Optimizeer (Adam)

##  Models Evaluated
 * Sequential
